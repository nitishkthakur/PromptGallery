## Standard UI practices
1. When designing borders or boundary lines of neighboring elements, maintain same level for alignment if it makes sense
2. Use FLUENT UI from Micirosoft design practices, buttons, elements, fonts, font hieratchies and color themes.
3. Select elegant and professional colors. Follow the primary color, lighter version of primary and complementary color (if reqd).
4. Define 3 levels of Font Hierarchies. use Segoe font.
5. Use Alpine and HTMX for JS
6. Make the UI extremely clean and elegant for professional use. Design it keeping senior leadership in mind
7. DO not use emojis anywhere
8. Default to dark theme unless the user asks for it.
9. Implement as much functionality on the backend as possible. Only if Frontend JS is thhe clear favourite, prefer using JS for functionality.

##Follow these overall rules:
1. Think before implementing
2. Dont destroy or break existing functionality
3. For complex changes or debugging, anticipate potential issues before even trying
